The Pahadi Organic,March 2021,50,The best stay till date,"We went there for our anniversary celebration, away from the citylife. Trust me, this was the best stay. The food was delicious, always fresh and cooked at the same time per your order which can be seen from the dining area or resturant. So please be patient. And the host-Chetan, the most genuine person who will never say no to any of your requests and will always try to fulfil it. The staff was very polite and helpful. And yes, plus point for the massage chair which was much needed even after a short trek. Definitely going to visit again."

The Pahadi Organic,December 2020,50,Great experience,"Apart from the lip smacking genuine Kumaoni food, a visit to Pahari Organic is an experience in itself. All the food you eat is grown or reared there itself. Veggies & herbs grown in polyfarms. Grow their own fruits & spices. Also have their own cows, hens, goats, quails etc. All good is cooked in traditional Kumaoni way in from of you by lairs separated by glass. No use of mixers. All utensils used are traditional brass, ceramic, clay & stone. The owners are also very friendly and arrange dor tour of the property. Very nice experience indeed and will highly recommend."
The Pahadi Organic,November 2020,50,Cultural Experience as it should,"Had the pleasure of visiting The Pahadi Organic a month back. If you are foodie who wants to experience authentically prepared true Uttarakhandi cuisines, this is the place to visit. The sheer depth of pride and love that is put into making the dishes from across the state is just amazing to experience. The authenticity of the food elevates with the quality of presentation and the thoughtful idea of employing the locals for a true to blend preparation. Rooms are simple and cozy, with a touch of the Pahadi architecture to them. I recommend it if cultural authenticity is something you really seek to experience as part of your travels."
The Pahadi Organic,November 2020,50,Great resort and for gateway trips,The ambience and the location of the resort is the main highlight. People looking for peacefull destinations wherein you could stay and get relaxed from stressfull life of the metropolitan this is the place for you . In the evening time the ambience is so good that one would not even regret having friends along and talking over drinks under the moon.

The Pahadi Organic,November 2020,50,A home from home üòá,"It was a wonderful experience staying at The organic Pahari. The purity of the traditional organic pahari food is an unforgettable experience. The rooms are spacious, an outdoor sitting with a beautiful Mountain View. The staff was very nice and helpful.

The Pahadi Organic,November 2020,50,Family trip,"We really needed a change after the long lockdown and the busy lives where we were not able to meet up people easily due to current pandemic, so decided to go on a small vacation and visited The Pahadi Organic. One of the best experiences that we all had, rooms were well ventilated, hygiene was well maintained, the staff was really co-operative, peaceful place,organic food well cooked and prepared and served on orders. All the food was prepared on the firewood and served in brass utensils. There was a parking space alloted by the hotel and kids playing area for the kids. Peace of mind,superb view, ultimate climate, good people, delicious food and in one word excellent time spent. Must visit if you need a break from a daily routine and relax."
The Pahadi Organic,October 2020,50,A must visit to savour in local pahadi cuisine.,"We had read fantastic reviews of this place and decided to visit for lunch during our recent visit to Corbett (Ramnagar). It was an hour's drive but totally worth the effort as we were welcomed with excellent local stuff. The owner Chetan is extremely affable and helped us plan the menu in advance; just had to call him a few hours earlier to confirm our visit. Everything is prepared in woodfire oven and cooked by local women with utmost care and hygiene. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, and everything is prepared fresh. We sampled in a delectable meal of arbi ke gutte, mooli saag, laal bhat, chicken curry pahadi style, assorted black wheat and madua rotis, bhatt ki chudkani (daal) and 2 types of desserts made with barnyard millet and ragi. The food was earthy, wholesome and absolutely soul satisfying. A must have if you happen to be in that area or enroute to ranikhet. The veggies are homegrown and the owner will happily take you around the terrace farms. Even the milk and ghee are not outsourced."
The Pahadi Organic,February 2020,40,A good experience,"We had read quite a bit about this place- as a true pahadi organic experience. So we drove over to have lunch and spend some time here. The motel stands right by the main highway overlooking a valley. It is built along the hillside and has quite a bit of land behind which has vegetable sheds, small terraced fields, an Ayurvedic Spa hut and a rotunda for great views, yoga and meditation. The entire interior is wood with local carvings. The rooms looked well appointed with tea service and the bathrooms neat and clean. The lounge follows the stretch of the rooms. The dining area extends to both sides of the entrance and there is a verandah on the outside. The food, ethnic 'pahadi' freshly prepared is good. Cooked on wood fired stoves, it is aromatic and varied. The Organic Pahadi‚Ä¶"
The Pahadi Organic,February 2020,50,Excellent Place to stay with healthy food and environment,"It was awesome experience visiting Pahadi Organic, though I visited the property for a meeting and was my first time there. Initially while moving to resort, the journey seems to be tedious but when you reached there it was worth it.. The view is very magical, every thing cooked is authentic and organic, you can see actually the authentic way your food is cooked. All natural and organic it was awesome, Truly don't have exact words to express my happiness. Apart from food you can experience the local culture, extracurricular activities like wall climbing, swimming in artificial wave pool, bike riding and many more. Would be visiting again, with my family."
The Pahadi Organic,January 2020,50,A Royal Gem on the Indian Mountain Side,"The Pahadi Organic Hotel and Resort in Gram Kholyon, Almora, India, is a magical place on a mountain side in the middle of rural India that will make you smile just by sitting on the balcony looking over the valleys and colors of nature. It is almost zen-like in its peacefulness. This hotel and resort is only 2 years old and is absolutely beautiful with its locally crafted wooden decor and very modern amenities. It is truly a royal gem and a wonderful place to stay. Another beauty of this hotel is that all the food served is totally organic, grown on the family property connected to the hotel. Everything is prepared fresh with home grown, ground fresh, organic spices. It is an extremely unique experience into the fabulous food of this region. The owner, Chetan Rawat, is‚Ä¶"

The Pahadi Organic,December 2019,50,Authentic Uttarakhand Food & Culture,"Had a 2 Nights stay at The Pahadi Organic. All food cooked in wood fire, desi ghee preparations and traditional food cooked traditionally and served traditionally. What an experience! The warm hospitality of staff, tidy rooms, fresh farms all around, adventure park in the property premise......2 nights were not enough to explore all. Would strongly recommend this stay with your family and friends. An hour's detour from the commercial & routine properties of Corbett with seamless Safari experience as well. Would definitely come again with family for a longer duration."
The Pahadi Organic,April 2019,50,Food review - authentic Pahadi cuisine - worth a detour just for food!,"Drove 40 KMS from Vanghat lodge to just have lunch here! The menu is exhaustive, full of authentic pahadi cuisine items listed for few pages and couldn't make anything out of it :) the good guys at Vanghat lodge had called the owner of this place indicating our visit. The 'Chef' was waiting and we let him have a go at preparing the meal than pick and choose items of which we had no clue! They have their own organic garden and most of the ingredients are sourced in house and cooked in old pahadi style cooking Lip smacking good and very very different than anything we have eaten before. This place turned out worth the hard 40+ KMS drive!"
The Pahadi Organic,October 2019,50,An absolutely fantastic stay,"The Pahadi Organic is one of the few places I have stayed in, where there is almost nothing negative to say. I visited this resort in October 2019 with my husband and daughter and eagerly await the next opportunity to go there. The ambience of the resort is fantastic with near rooms and bathrooms. The rooms on the front side of the property overlook a valley and address extremely comfortable. The resort has its own greenhouses where they grow vegetables. The unique point about this resort is that it's menu is seasonal. So whatever food is served on your plate has been harvested from the resort's gardens just as you place your order. This is the reason they ask you to place your order sufficiently in advance. If a particular vegetable is not growing in their gardens at a‚Ä¶"
The Pahadi Organic,November 2019,50,Garden of Eden,"My husband and I are missing this place so much that I couldn‚Äôt help reminiscing it through a review. This Place definitely stands true to its name! It is every bit pahadi and every bit organic. Located amidst the lush green forests of Uttarakhand. It is about 1.5 hrs drive from Jim Corbett(appx.40kms). Will list out a couple of pointers that left me in awe of this amazing property. The host: Chetan, is this really down to earth human being, who btw also happens to be the owner of this place. If it wasn‚Äôt for him, this trip would have not been the extraordinary it was. I will mention him at a couple of places in my post ahead. Organic Food: The food menu is a plethora of exotic dishes(both veg and non-veg). From spices to veggies to poultry, everything is grown‚Ä¶"
The Pahadi Organic,November 2019,50,Awesome Hospitality and authentic Kumaoni food!,"This little gem is hidden on road to Raniket from Jim Corbett in middle of nowhere. If you are a city dweller who wants peace , solace and fresh air then this the place for you. I visited this place for hill training of cycle rides and my hill runs. The owner goes to extreme heights to give you an extraordinary experience . Be it for request for special candle light dinner, bon fire or some local dance & music. Everything was well taken care-off. As the name suggests all meal prepared is farmed in the property be it vegetables, milk or poultry and is organic. I chanced upon this place through Trip advisor. I thought how can somebody get certificate of excellence. Now I know why the ratings are so high. I can vouch for its authentic local food. I & my family tried almost‚Ä¶"
The Pahadi Organic,November 2019,50,Amazing !!!,"We stayed at the Pahadi during our stay in Jim Corbett for 2 days. We were greeted with a warm welcome and an efficient check in process.  The rooms were big and stocked with everything we needed. The furnishings were very clean and met our needs. We also had a mountain side view on the balcony side of our room.  One thing that I really loved about Pahadi is its food. The breakfast was exceptional every day with a lot of variety of organic local food dishes. We ate dinner here in the main restaurant and it met our expectations as well and the food was reasonably priced for the area.  The hotel has a very well maintained garden space where guests can take a walk and experience the farming sheer up close. The Pahadi has its own small adventurous activities zone where my family including my 2.5 yr old nephew really enjoyed.  What really made our stay exceptional, though, was the hospitality of Chetan, the owner. He is extraordinarily friendly, attentive to detail, and concerned to ensure every guest has a wonderful stay. Chetan himself took us out on sightseeing the nearby areas.  Thanks Chetan and all of the staff for a wonderful stay! I look forward to visiting again someday."
The Pahadi Organic,November 2019,50,Perfect Weekend trip to Corbett,"The experience was beyond words. We spent a quality time with nature. Food was of utmost quality, tasty and healthy. Room was very neat and clean. The best part was staff and their dedication to treat customers well. There was a cultural show at night with bone fire üî•. I would recommend it for a group or couple for a perfect weekend getaway."
The Pahadi Organic,October 2019,50,Great Place to relax in the lap of nature,The Pahadi Organic is a very great place for a vacation with your family. We loved the organic food there which they cook on chulha. The hospitality is beyond the expectations. Everything was awesome.
